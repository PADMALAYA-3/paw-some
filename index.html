        <h2>Snake</h2>
        <p>
          I have a personal inclination towards snakes because of the spiritual
          significance that they carry. They remind us, as a part of their life
          practice, that it is important to shed our scales and let go of the
          old and unserving part of ourselves.

        <h2>Calf</h2>
        <p>
          While the world loves the cow, for the obvious reason that it provides
          milk; I have a rather soft spot for the calves. They come across as
          exceptionally innocent and carefree. Their eyes attract me the most. I
          just love the fact how domesticated and non-harming they're.

        <h2>Kitten</h2>
        <p>
          If there is one animal I am all hearts for, then they are the kittens.
          Reasons would fall short why one wouldn't love these fluffiest of
          creatures. They're lovely,cute and snuggle-worthy. So much so that, I
          have named my project by their paws.

        <h2>Camel</h2>
        <p>
          Not everyone is designed to walk on rough terrains and sustain the dry
          weathers. The ones who are designed though are very special to me.
          Camels for this reason stand tall in my eyes and in the deserts.
          They're an embodiment of tolerance and adaptability.

        <h2>Dog</h2>
        <p>
          There is hardly anyone who doesn't like a pup or a dog. These wiggly
          creatures are the most giving, endearing and loyal. No wonder they're
          humans best friend.

        <h2>Elephant</h2>
        <p>
          These huge mammals are not just a visionary treat, but also very
          harmless. Their stature could easily earn them the king of the jungle,
          but these fuss-free creatures choose not to fight for dominance. This
          fact has my heart. They're extremely emotional and that makes them
          human-friendly.

        <h2>Lion</h2>
        <p>
          While I admire the elephant's quality to not chase for domination, I
          equally like the lion's hunt. It just hunts in such a fashion, that it
          earns the title "king of the jungle for itself". I guess potential
          should demand power. That is exactly the case here.

        <h2>Seagull</h2>
        <p>
          One single book that I read early in my life, had me fascinate and
          obsess over the Seagulls. On that, they're extremely good-looking.
          Their images under the blue sky of the Antarctic are just divine.

        <h2>Swans</h2>
        <p>
          It is said that swans have a peculiar skill of distinguishing pearls
          from mud. This ability reflects their innate purity. It is said that
          swans cannot live without their partners and they always exist in
          pairs. They almost starve themselves to death, if one of them dies.
          Everything about the swan makes them my favorite.

        <h2>Tiger</h2>
        <p>
          When I first learnt about the Bengal Tigers, is when I started having
          deep fascination for them. They come across as extremely royal. The
          fact that no two tigers have the same stripes on their body, makes me
          relate with them a lot. No two humans have the same fingerprint as
          well. Nature always gives us cues, that we all belong to her.

        <h2>Horse</h2>
        <p>
          Every animal by far is liked by me, because of the peculiar traits
          that they possess. But white horse has a very special place both in my
          heart and mind for its mythological importance. In Hinduism, it is
          believed that the 10th avatar of Lord Vishnu, the "KALKI" avatar,
          would come riding on a white horse. Millions of devotees here in my
          land are awaiting his arrival. Interestingly, what I have recently
          found out is that, almost every major religion like Christianity,
          Islam and Judaism believe that the world saviour would come riding on
          a white horse. All of us are looking forward to this messiah. And here
          I am taming my white-horse mind, racing from here and there. My soul
          has been it's riding saint.

        <h2>Pigeon</h2>
        <p>
          One of my vivid memories from my childhood Independence Day
          celebration, was the unfurling of the tricolor, the pride of singing
          the national anthem and at times when few people decide to fly a white
          pigeon. Since, time immemorial, white pigeons are considered
          harvestors of good luck and peace. That is exactly what I pray for,
          that after all is said and done, let "peace" remain!
